The user should select which month to edit

need to know what months are available
    *generate a file that writes each time a new month file is created
    *read the file on startup and create a list of months
need a screen that displays all the available months (buttons)
    *create a new method and create a new frame
    *loop through the list and create a button for each month in the list
clicking a button brings user to the main input screen
    *each button will call a method to switch the current month
    *next screen should be homeScreen method

no need for the configuration file since user will select months
selecting the month will switch the current month
slecting income/expense will switch the current input type

need to add an input section for bills
each month this file will be copied over
user needs an option to edit this file
    need a way to display the file contents in the window
    user should be able to add and remove entries easily
        "x" button to delete
        "add" button at the bottom to insert a new bill

******************************************
SUMMARY ISSUE ##SOLVED##
******************************************
Summary relies on opening the self.income_file and self.expense_file
which were both removed in the last merge. Will need to define these files
sometime when the user selects the month

******************************************
MAIN BACK BUTTON
******************************************
Once the year and month are selected, there is no way to go back to the 
year/month selection screens. Need to create some way of moving backwards
from this area.
