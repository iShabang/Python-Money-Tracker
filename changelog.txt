Took out print statements and replaced them with logging
"log.txt" is created and stores all logging messages
Fixed a bug with the month buttons. Each button was passing the current month instead of
the one the button represented. Adjusted the lambda expression to take the current instance of 
the variable "month" when creating the buttons
Init method now attempts to create the year and month lists. No longer dependant on the config file
